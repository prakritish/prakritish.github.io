## [ORM - SQLAlchemy](https://blog.seneshore.com/docs/Flask-SQLAlchemy.html)
**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a powerful programming technique that bridges the gap between the 
world of object-oriented programming and relational databases. It simplifies database interactions by 
allowing developers to work with databases using Python classes and objects, rather than writing complex 
SQL queries. In this context, **Flask-SQLAlchemy** is an extension for the Flask web framework that 
seamlessly integrates SQLAlchemy, a popular Python library for working with databases, into Flask 
applications. Flask-SQLAlchemy empowers Flask developers to define data models as Python classes, 
providing a clear and intuitive way to map database tables to objects. It simplifies tasks such as 
querying, data manipulation, and database schema management, making it an ideal choice for building 
web applications that require a clean and efficient database interface while leveraging the simplicity 
and flexibility of Flask's web development framework.

## [Jenkins - Parallel Builds](https://blog.seneshore.com/devops/cicd/jenkins/2023/10/09/jenkins-parallel-builds.html)
The article provides a comprehensive examination of parallel builds within Jenkins pipelines, with a particular emphasis on their application in managing complex pipeline scenarios.
It's essential to highlight that Jenkins' approach to parallel builds, as discussed in the article, can be seen as analogous to GitHub Actions' Matrix Builds. Both Jenkins and GitHub Actions allow for the parallel execution of jobs across different configurations, such as various platforms and versions. However, a key distinction lies in the implementation and flexibility. While GitHub Actions offers a built-in matrix feature for defining parallel jobs easily, Jenkins requires a more scripted approach for achieving similar functionality, as outlined in the article.
This distinction underscores the importance of understanding and tailoring the pipeline tool to suit specific project requirements and preferences.

## [Jenkins - Shared Library](https://blog.seneshore.com/devops/cicd/jenkins/2023/10/05/jenkins-shared-library.html)
In my journey, after nearly a year away from Jenkins, I found myself returning to Jenkins for a new project. As I delved back into it, I realized the need to refresh my memory. 

While scouring through documentation and YouTube videos for Jenkins Shared Library, I was surprised to discover that while there's a wealth of resources for standard `/var` folder-based libraries, there's a notable lack of information for `/src` folder-based libraries. 

This article is an attempt to bridge that gap to an extent and cover how we can organise our Jenkins shared library using the `/src` directory and ultimately use them in our declarative pipeline.
