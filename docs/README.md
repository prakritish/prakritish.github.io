## [ORM - SQLAlchemy](https://blog.seneshore.com/docs/Flask-SQLAlchemy.html)
**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a powerful programming technique that bridges the gap between the 
world of object-oriented programming and relational databases. It simplifies database interactions by 
allowing developers to work with databases using Python classes and objects, rather than writing complex 
SQL queries. In this context, **Flask-SQLAlchemy** is an extension for the Flask web framework that 
seamlessly integrates SQLAlchemy, a popular Python library for working with databases, into Flask 
applications. Flask-SQLAlchemy empowers Flask developers to define data models as Python classes, 
providing a clear and intuitive way to map database tables to objects. It simplifies tasks such as 
querying, data manipulation, and database schema management, making it an ideal choice for building 
web applications that require a clean and efficient database interface while leveraging the simplicity 
and flexibility of Flask's web development framework.
